## Why

Serverless applications tend to be fairly complex with many albeit relatively simple moving parts.
Its ecosystem is constantly evolving and adding even more into the mix.

Considering this environment, we don't hear enough real-world horror stories to learn from each other!

This compilation of failure stories should make it easier for people dealing with serverless applications to
learn from others and reduce the unknown unknowns of running serverless in production.
